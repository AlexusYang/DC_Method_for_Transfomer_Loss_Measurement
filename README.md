# DC_Method_for_Transfomer_Loss_Measurement

This project is designed to introduce a DC Loss Method for Transformer Loss Measurement, which we could be useful in modeling the transformer losses in power electronic applications.
The proposed method is detailed in an unpublished TPEL paper, involving in utilizing Artificial Neural Network.
Here containes the code and data. 

Main code is in Main_Code_Mathemetica_Script.nb, which is a Mathematica Script.
The code is encrypted, you can run it in Mathematica,or in https://www.wolframcloud.com/
WorkZone folder should be placed in the root directory of the D://, before executing the script. Alternatively, you may modify the folder definition within the script itself.
